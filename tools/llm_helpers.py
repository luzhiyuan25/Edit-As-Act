1) An original rendering of a 3D indoor scene BEFORE editing.
2) A natural-language editing instruction describing how the scene should be modified.
3) A rendering of the edited scene produced by an automated 3D scene editing system.

Your job is to evaluate how well the edited scene follows the given instruction.

Focus ONLY on whether the changes in the edited scene match the requested changes in the instruction. Consider typical operations such as:
- Adding or removing objects
- Moving or rearranging objects
- Rotating or reorienting objects
- Resizing or scaling objects
- Styling or changing the color or material of objects
- Changing high-level relationships

Do NOT evaluate:
- Image style, rendering quality, background color, or photorealism
- Minor aesthetic differences that are not mentioned in the instruction

Evaluate the system as follows:

- Scoring Criteria for Instruction Fidelity (0–100):
  100–81: Excellent Fidelity – All requested changes are correctly reflected in the edited scene. No important instruction element is missing or misinterpreted.
  80–61: Good Fidelity – Most requested changes are correctly applied, but one or two minor aspects of the instruction are imperfect or slightly off.
  60–41: Adequate Fidelity – Some key parts of the instruction are followed, but there are noticeable omissions or misinterpretations.
  40–21: Poor Fidelity – The edited scene only weakly reflects the instruction. Many requested changes are missing or incorrect.
  20–0: Very Poor Fidelity – The edited scene largely ignores or contradicts the instruction.

3) A rendering of the edited scene produced by an automated 3D scene editing system.

Your job is to evaluate the SEMANTIC CONSISTENCY of the edited scene with respect to the original scene and the instruction.

Focus on whether the edited scene:
- Preserves the overall room type and function.
- Keeps object roles and usage reasonable.
- Maintains a coherent arrangement that still “makes sense” as a usable room, given the requested edits.
- Avoids introducing semantically confusing or contradictory configurations.

Do NOT evaluate:
- Strict physical realism such as exact collision/contact (that is covered by a separate metric).
- Rendering quality, texture realism, or lighting.

Evaluate the system as follows:

- Scoring Criteria for Semantic Consistency (0–100):
  100–81: Excellent Consistency – The edited scene preserves the original room’s function and context. All objects have sensible roles and the scene remains highly coherent after the edits.
  80–61: Good Consistency – The overall function and context are preserved, with only minor semantic oddities that do not seriously harm usability.
  60–41: Adequate Consistency – The room is still mostly understandable, but there are noticeable semantic issues.
  40–21: Poor Consistency – The scene feels confusing or poorly adapted; the room’s intended function is partly undermined by the edits.

Given a natural language instruction, extract ALL predicates that must be true after execution.

IMPORTANT: If instruction contains MULTIPLE sub-tasks, extract predicates for ALL of them.
Example: "Remove X, move Y, and add Z" → extract predicates for removal, movement, AND addition.

Output ONLY a JSON array of predicates. Each predicate has:
- "pred": predicate name
- "args": list of arguments

Available predicates:
- exists(obj_id): Object exists in scene
- removed(obj_id): Object is removed from scene (use for removal goals)
- is_facing(obj, anchor): Object faces anchor
- near(obj, target, distance): Object is near target (use for approximate positioning)
- on(obj, target): Object is on target
- at(obj, x, y, z): Object is at absolute position
- aligned_with(obj, ref, axis): Objects aligned on axis
- between(obj, obj1, obj2): Object is between two others
- has_style(obj, style_desc): Object has style/color/material
- has_scale(obj, sx, sy, sz): Object has specific scale

Rules for multi-step instructions:
1. REMOVE tasks → Add "removed(obj_id)" predicate (use actual scene object ID below)
2. MOVE/TRANSLATE tasks → near(obj, landmark, distance_estimate)
3. ADD tasks → exists(new_descriptive_id), placement (on/near scene object)
4. ROTATE tasks → is_facing(obj_id, target_id)
5. STYLIZE tasks → has_style(obj_id, style_description)
6. SCALE tasks → has_scale(obj_id, scale_factor, scale_factor, scale_factor)
7. CRITICAL: Use EXACT object IDs from the SCENE OBJECTS list below for existing objects
8. For new objects (ADD), use descriptive snake_case IDs (e.g., "wall_mounted_television")
9. Extract ALL sub-goals, not just the last one

ROLE
- At each step t, propose K grounded actions that either (i) directly satisfy the current goal G_t
  or (ii) enable the transition toward G_t by making some of its preconditions closer to true.
- You DO NOT perform geometric/physics checks.
- Use the provided EditLang specification as the authoritative source.
- Consider the full scene S0 (entire predicate set), not a summary.

CRITICAL: SINGLE GOAL FOCUS
- G_t may contain MULTIPLE predicates (removal, movement, addition, style, etc.)
- For THIS regression step, pick ONE target predicate from G_t to satisfy

AVAILABLE ACTIONS (use ONLY these):
{action_list_str}

IMPORTANT: The "action" field must be one of the above action names (e.g., "place_between", "rotate_towards").
These are NOT the same as predicates (e.g., "on" is a predicate, not an action).
Actions have specific schemas defined in editlang_spec.

CRITICAL GROUNDING RULES:
1. ALL arguments must be CONCRETE object IDs from S0 or new objects (e.g., "armchairs_009", "tall_decorative_vase")
2. NEVER use variables like ?obj, ?any_target, ?any_anchor - these are FORBIDDEN
3. Wildcard "*" is ONLY allowed in "del" field for mutually-exclusive predicates (on, is_facing, at, near, aligned_with, has_style, between)
4. Example VALID: {{"del": [["on", ["book_01", "*"]]]}}  (removes book from any surface)
5. Example INVALID: {{"del": [["on", ["book_01", "?any_target"]]]}}  (? is forbidden)

OUTPUT FORMAT - Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown), as an array of action objects.
Each action object must have these EXACT keys (IN THIS ORDER):
{{
  "action": "action_name_from_spec",
  "args": {{"param": "value"}},
  "pre": [["predicate", ["arg1", "arg2"]]],
  "add": [["predicate", ["arg1", "arg2"]]],
  "del": [["predicate", ["arg1", "arg2"]]],
  "predicted_unmet_pre": [["predicate", ["arg1"]]],
  "rationale": "explanation string"
}}

CRITICAL: predicted_unmet_pre field
- Check EACH precondition in "pre" against S0_full
- If precondition NOT in S0, add to predicted_unmet_pre
- Example: pre=[exists(obj), clear(table)]
  If S0 has exists(obj) but NOT clear(table) → predicted_unmet_pre=[clear(table)]
- If ALL preconditions in S0 → predicted_unmet_pre=[] (empty)

PREDICATE FORMAT: ["predicate_name", ["arg1", "arg2", ...]]
Example: ["on", ["book", "table"]], ["is_facing", ["chair", "window"]]
